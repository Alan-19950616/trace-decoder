To build the dqr executable and the dqr shared library (currently needed for using the dqr directly from
Java) are described below. These libraries are required because the dqr uses Risc-V versions of libbfd,
libibtery, and libopcodes.

The libraries to build the dqr executable and library are different on different platforms
windows, Linux, and Mac OS X). Below, what is needed for each platform is listed.

Windows:

The Windows static libraries are in the windows subfolder. They are built when freedom-tools is built, and
will be coppied into the trace-decoder\lib\windows folder that is built at the same time. Pre-built versions
of the libraries are provided with the trace-decoder, but they may be an older version (but should still
work). The static libraries needed by the windows version of the dqr are:

libbfd.a
libiberty.a
libintl.a
libopcodes.a
libz.a

Linux:

Building on Linux requries the static libraries below:

libbfd.a
libiberty.a
libopcodes.a
libz.a

Pre-built versions are provided, but they are also built when doing a freedom-tools build.

Some additional libraries are required to build the shared dqr library on Linux. This is because by default
Linux does not compile the libraries using the -fPIC option, which is needed to make the dqr dynamic library
when using the dqr from a Java application.

When building freedom-tools on Linux, it will build versions of the libaries needed for the dqr executable, and
the dqr shared (dynamic) libraries. The versions for creating the shared dqr library will be placed in the
picbfd, picliberty, and picopcodes folders in the freedom-tools obj/x86_64-linux-ubuntu14/build/trace-decoder/trace-decoder/lib/linux folder.

Prebuilt versions are provided for building both the dqr executable and the dqr shared library.

Mac OS X:

Building on Mac OS X requries the static libraries below:

libbfd.a
libiberty.a
libopcodes.a
libz.a

These libraries are built by freedom-tools using the -fPIC options, so they are all that is needed.

Include files:

Include files for the libraries are in the trace-decoder/include folder (ansidecl.h, bfd.h, config.h,
dis-asm.h, and symcat.h).
